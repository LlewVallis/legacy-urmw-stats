          <div>
            Boom boom, pew pew pew, incoming missiles, perwerwerr...     Zorua is a strange creature.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            The Zorua species is quite special. In a Zorua's early years, they are red hot with a fierce appearance. However, once mature, they strangely grow Elsa hair and start wearing Elsa clothes. Remarkably, all their voices are akin to those of Grian, SimplySarc and Brian Cox. This phenomenon has fascinated turtles and CAGs alike.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            After much observation, leading Grianologists have concluded that the aforementioned "Zorua" appears to be mechanical in nature. The robotic pokemon is enslaved by URMW to produce Muller Corners so that all staff may retire in the fully autonomous Utopia it will build us. Unfortunately, the Zorua occasionally malfunctions, such as when it confuses the "kick from server" and "disconnect from voicechat" buttons. After a sufficient quantity of errors have occured, the staff team will use negative reinforcement in the form of achievements to train the Zorua.

          <h1>Corn</h1>
          <div>
            Chronos is a piston. Pistons are crafted from 3 wood planks, 4 cobblestone, 1 iron and 1 redstone dust. Chronos, however, is a special piston: he possesses the magic power of a mysterious power named JL2579 whom is the goddess of all in the virtual world known as CubeKrowd. Chronos has therefore been granted, by the gods, the best casting voice known to humanity to date, as well as the spiciest screams emitted from his mouth when CAG takes no knockback. His screams are ionising, comparable to the power of alpha radiation but with the range of beta radiation.

          <h1>Teletortie</h1>
          <div>
            Llewv, also known as "the magic ping abusing turtle" by some, is a meme in some respects. With a scientific name of Testudines Llew Vallis, his ability to ride missiles and negate knockback is unmatched.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Llewv claims that his "Australian internet" is to blame for his anti-knockback capabilities. However, players have speculated otherwise: some speculate he is pure magic, while others have more logical explanations such as how he hides in his shell like a coward when someone approaches him. However, sometimes he manages to get tipped upside down by players such as LordsGame. When captured, Llewv's meat is extracted and made into turtle soup, which is then drank by his team to boost their morale. However, being immortal, Llewv always rubberbands back into his previous position and continues playing normally.

          <h1>Dr. Akan</h1>
          <div>
            Drakan, also know as Dr. Akan PhD in Flying TNT Machines, is in many ways a mastermind of URMW. Like the fabled Zorua, Drakan has been enslaved by the URMW staff to write a sentient slave known as "Muller Corner" to calculate players' imaginary skill points. However, people do not yell at Drakan. This is because he has admin permissions, and will willingly give the role "Thou shalt be fired again" to anyone who opposes him.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Also known as the deafener, his signature quote is "Would you like to be deafened?". However, the staff have embraced his will for removing the hearing of players. Llewv has become a very good deafener, as his anti-kb makes people scream so loud they deafen themselves. Therefore, Drakan has awarded Llewv with the title of "Spice".
          </div>

          <h1>Overdue Cuppa</h1>
          <div>
            The peculiar entity Leiti, also known as "LeitiLP", "Leit", "Yeiti", "Yeti", "Latie", "Leetee", "CAG's alt", or "Hacker", is arguably one of the best, if not the best Missile Wars players on the planet. With one swoop in his LeitiLP series, your Leit portal will be Yeiti'd into nothing as if he's a Yeti. For tournaments, he is a Latie, always arriving late to make his opponents more restless and easier to beat, all the while Zor mispronounces his name as "Leetee". CAG, having part of their face in his skin, has earned this entity the nickname of "CAG's alt". Oh look, it's fly hacking. What a Hacker.
